<b># English to Pig Latin Translator</b> <br><br>

1. If a word starts with a vowel, just add way to the end of the word.
2. If a word starts with a consonant, move the consonants before the first vowel to the end of the word and add ay.
3. If a word starts with the letter Y, the Y should be treated as a consonant.
        If the Y appears anywhere else in the word, it should be treated as a vowel.
4. Keep the case of the original word whether it’s uppercase (TEST), title case (Test), or lowercase (test).
5. Keep all punctuation at the end of the translated word.
6. Translate words with contractions. For example, can’t should be an’tcay.
7. Don’t translate words that contain numbers or symbols. For example, 123 should be left as 123,
		and bill@microsoft.com should be left as bill @microsoft.com.
8. Check that the user has entered text before performing the translation.
